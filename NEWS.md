# estimators 0.7.0

* Created the estim and avar functions that cover all distributions and estimation methods.
* Added ll<distrname> functions that calculate the log-likelihood to provide support in the default R style.
* Added e<distrname> functions that perform parameter estimation to provide support in the default R style.
* Added v<distrname> functions that calculate the estimator asymptotic variance to provide support in the default R style.
* Removed the me2 and same2 estimators. Added "dirich" argument to the MGamma me and same estimators.
* Moved package distr from Depends to Imports.
* Added testthat coverage.
* Ran rhub and devtools checks for cran release.
* Complied by goodpractice::gp().
